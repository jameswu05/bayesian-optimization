Basic pseudo-code for Bayesian optimization
Place a Gaussian process prior on f
Observe f at n_0 points according to an initial space-filling experimental design
Set n = n_0
while n <= N do
	Update the posterior probability distribution on f using all available data
	Let x_n be a maximizer of the acquisition function over x, where the acquisition function is computed using the current posterior distribution
	Observe y_n = f(x_n)
	Increment n
end while
